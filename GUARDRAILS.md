Last Updated: 2026-02-15

## Architecture Guardrails
- No changes to core architecture without EXPLORE mode
- No silent replacement of existing modules

## Code Guardrails
- No fabricated requirements or business logic
- Mark assumptions explicitly
- Follow existing patterns before introducing new ones

## Deployment Guardrails
- Build must pass before deploy
- No force-push to main/master
